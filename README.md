# Robot-Arm-Simulation-with-Task-Sequencing
Robotic Arm Simulation using NiryoOne on CoppeliaSim with efficient Task Sequencing

A Robotic Arm simulation in CoppeliaSim, which would create a wall using the random blocks generated in its workspace. The path created for the robot to move is done using path-planning algorithms like A* search and RRT. The project was done using the zmqRemote Python API in CoppeliaSim, making the coding easily done on Visual Studio Code.
